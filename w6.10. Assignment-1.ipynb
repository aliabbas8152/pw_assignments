    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It uniquely identifies each row and ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data. Here are key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniqueness:** Each value in the primary key column must be unique across the entire table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-null:** The primary key column cannot contain null values. Every row must have a valid, non-null primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Index:** Primary keys are often automatically indexed by the database management system (DBMS) to optimize search and retrieval operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Immutable:** The values in the primary key should ideally be immutable, meaning they should not change over time. This ensures stability in the identification of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(255),\n",
    "    department_id INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `employee_id` is the primary key for the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, creating a relationship. Key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Referential Integrity:** A foreign key enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationships:** Foreign keys define relationships between tables. For example, in a relational database, an \"orders\" table might have a foreign key that references the primary key of a \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cascade Actions:** Foreign keys can be configured with cascade actions such as `CASCADE DELETE` or `CASCADE UPDATE`. If a referenced record is deleted or updated, the corresponding action is automatically applied to related records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
